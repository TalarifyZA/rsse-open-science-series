## About the RSSE Open Science Series

We are planning a monthly virtual discussion series aimed at increasing the participation of African and Asian researchers involved in developing and maintaining research software and systems (data/computing hardware) in the [global RSE movement.](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0).

The series focuses on the link between research software (and systems) and open science and how these technologies can and should be employed to enable open science.
